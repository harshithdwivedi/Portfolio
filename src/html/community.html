            From creating my GitHub account on the first tech meet up I attended over 3 years ago to 2400+ commits later, I couldn't really thank the community enough for their help in shaping my career and myself as a person.

                  I'm also a speaker at Google's Mobile Developer Fest which is a program focused on promoting Android Development among University and college students. I've spoken there in the past on how this is the perfect time to be a Mobile Developer and how to make a career in the said field.
